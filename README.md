# ðŸ’« About Me:

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Itamar, a Software Developer with hands-on experience in software development, game development, and building AI-driven solutions.

In the world of game development, I love crafting fun, engaging experiences that bring ideas to life. I've worked with Unity to develop immersive 3D games  and Iâ€™m always exploring new tools and frameworks to level up my skills.

My tech stack includes Java, C#, and Python, and Iâ€™m comfortable working with Unity, Android development, and databases. 

Whether it's building smart features, solving challenging problems, or collaborating on creative projects, Iâ€™m always looking to grow and make meaningful contributions.

Currently looking for a Junior Developer position.<br><br>
